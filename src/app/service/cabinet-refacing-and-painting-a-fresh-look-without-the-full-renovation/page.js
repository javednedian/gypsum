  <p className="my-4">Sometimes, your kitchen doesn’t need a complete overhaul, it just needs a refresh. Cabinet refacing and cabinet painting offer an affordable, high-impact way to breathe new life into your kitchen without the cost, time, or disruption of a full remodel.</p>

  <p className="my-4">If your cabinet frames are still structurally sound but the doors, hardware, or finishes are outdated or worn, our services are the perfect solution. At [Company], we specialize in kitchen cabinet refacing and kitchen cabinet painting that transform existing cabinetry into stunning focal points.</p>

  <p className="my-4">Refacing involves cabinet door replacement and updating drawer fronts, while the visible surfaces of the frames are covered with high-quality veneer or laminate to match. Combine this with expert painting, hardware upgrades, and detailing, and your kitchen feels brand new, at a fraction of the cost of full replacement.</p>
