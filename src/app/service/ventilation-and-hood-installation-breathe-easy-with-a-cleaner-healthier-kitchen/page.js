                <p className="my-4">A beautiful kitchen is only as good as the air you breathe in it. Cooking generates steam, smoke, grease, odors, and heat, and without proper ventilation, all of it lingers in your home, clinging to walls, ceilings, and fabrics. That’s why a well-installed kitchen ventilation system and kitchen exhaust hood aren’t optional, they’re essential.</p>
                <p className="my-4">At [Company], we specialize in professional kitchen hood installation and range hood installation services that keep your kitchen clean, fresh, and comfortable. Whether you’re an occasional cook or a passionate home chef, the right hood makes all the difference.</p>
